dropdown list returns data, and new data form successfully posts data. added about page. Next, google map api configuration.

Update: added contact page, configured with nodemailer and about page

Update: Added user collection, still needs work.

update: can post users, make an http request to them, added basic strategy. Cannot authorize a user yet, or hash a password.

update: isValid is always returning false! needs fixing.

update: hashing working. deleting is not yet.

update: migrating app from several pages to a single page, with separate login and sign up pages. In the middle of the process, so code is messy. Also worked a bit on the html/css.
