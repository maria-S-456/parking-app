This is a parking app which helps users find open parking spots in five cities. It is built with javascript, html/css, bootstrap, ejs, and node.

update: Fixed issue where parking locations were sorted incorrectly upon the first submission, then correctly after submitting again. Now, they are sorted correctly the first time.
